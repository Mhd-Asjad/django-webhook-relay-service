# Django Webhook Relay Service

A Django-based webhook relay service that securely receives incoming webhook data and forwards it to one or more destinations configured for an account.  
Each account is assigned a unique secret token (`CL-X-TOKEN`) to authenticate incoming webhook requests.  
Destinations include their own URLs, HTTP methods, and custom headers, and are automatically deleted when the associated account is deleted.
